Customer in Mind

Since the Conductor is the true customer of our product, we aimed to make a simple, yet effective
method of conveying information to the Conductor. The GUI was made with simple icons that would glow
and a suggested course of action would appear, promted with a sound. This was to ensure that the Conductor
could quickly see what the suggested action is and be able to respond quickly and precisely. The suggested actions
are short with large font, which makes them very readable. The icons that glows in response to what is detected
by the sensors are very distinct from each other and represent show the Conductor why the suggested action is 
being suggestion.
